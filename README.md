### Other info

#### Somethingâ€¦
I don't have any other project since I deleted by [BDthemes](https://github.com/YTGamer/bdthemes) repo. I realized that all what I made before is discontinued now and don't want to start another. Now I maintain what you can see above in Useful links.

#### Outside of my phone/computer
I'm on Nintendo Switch, if you want to add me, join my Discord server (in Useful links), validate the rules and send `!switch` in the **#cmds** channel.
